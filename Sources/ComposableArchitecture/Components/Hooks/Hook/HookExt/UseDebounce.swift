This is especially useful in scenarios such as handling user input or triggering network requests, where it effectively reduces unnecessary computations and ensures that resource-intensive operations are only performed after a pause in the input activity.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - value: The value that you want to debounce. This can be of any type.
///   - delay: The delay time in milliseconds. After this amount of time, the latest value is used.
/// - Returns: The debounced value. After the delay time has passed without the value changing, this will be updated to the latest value.

/// A hook to use memoized value preserved until it is updated at the timing determined with given `updateStrategy`.
///
/// Publishes elements only after a specified time interval elapses between events.
///
/// Use the ``Publisher/debounce(for:scheduler:options:)`` operator to control the number of values and time between delivery of values from the upstream publisher. This operator is useful to process bursty or high-volume event streams where you need to reduce the number of values delivered to the downstream to a rate you specify.
///
/// In this example, a ``PassthroughSubject`` publishes elements on a schedule defined by the `bounces` array. The array is composed of tuples representing a value sent by the ``PassthroughSubject``, and a <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Foundation/TimeInterval> ranging from one-quarter second up to 2 seconds that drives a delivery timer. As the queue builds, elements arriving faster than one-half second `debounceInterval` are discarded, while elements arriving at a rate slower than `debounceInterval` are passed through to the ``Publisher/sink(receiveValue:)`` operator.
///
///     let bounces:[(Int,TimeInterval)] = [
///         (0, 0),
///         (1, 0.25),  // 0.25s interval since last index
///         (2, 1),     // 0.75s interval since last index
///         (3, 1.25),  // 0.25s interval since last index
///         (4, 1.5),   // 0.25s interval since last index
///         (5, 2)      // 0.5s interval since last index
///     ]
///
///     let subject = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
///     cancellable = subject
///         .debounce(for: .seconds(0.5), scheduler: RunLoop.main)
///         .sink { index in
///             print ("Received index \(index)")
///         }
///
///     for bounce in bounces {
///         DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + bounce.1) {
///             subject.send(bounce.0)
///         }
///     }
///
///     // Prints:
///     //  Received index 1
///     //  Received index 4
///     //  Received index 5
///
///     //  Here is the event flow shown from the perspective of time, showing value delivery through the `debounce()` operator:
///
///     //  Time 0: Send index 0.
///     //  Time 0.25: Send index 1. Index 0 was waiting and is discarded.
///     //  Time 0.75: Debounce period ends, publish index 1.
///     //  Time 1: Send index 2.
///     //  Time 1.25: Send index 3. Index 2 was waiting and is discarded.
///     //  Time 1.5: Send index 4. Index 3 was waiting and is discarded.
///     //  Time 2: Debounce period ends, publish index 4. Also, send index 5.
///     //  Time 2.5: Debounce period ends, publish index 5.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - dueTime: The time the publisher should wait before publishing an element.
///   - scheduler: The scheduler on which this publisher delivers elements
///   - options: Scheduler options that customize this publisherâ€™s delivery of elements.
/// - Returns: A publisher that publishes events only after a specified time elapses.
